# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## 📝 Problem Statement

Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, sex, class, and fare using Machine Learning algorithms.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source:** Seaborn Titanic dataset / [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **Features Used:**
  - Pclass (Passenger class)
  - Sex
  - Age
  - SibSp (No. of siblings/spouses)
  - Parch (No. of parents/children)
  - Fare
  - Embarked

---

## ⚙️ Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

---

## 🔍 Steps Followed

1. **Data Loading:** Loaded dataset using pandas
2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Checked data structure, missing values, and visualised survival counts
3. **Data Cleaning:** Filled missing age values, dropped unnecessary columns with too many missing values
4. **Feature Engineering:** Converted categorical columns to numerical using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding
5. **Train-Test Split:** Split data into training and testing sets
6. **Model Building:** Trained Logistic Regression model for classification
7. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix
8. **Visualisations:** Plotted survival rate by gender and class for insights

---

## 🎯 Results

- **Algorithm Used:** Logistic Regression
- **Accuracy Achieved:** 81%
- **Key Findings:**
  - Females had higher survival rate than males
  - Passengers in higher class had better chances of survival

## 💡 Conclusion

This project enhanced my understanding of:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques
- Feature engineering to prepare data for models
- Building and evaluating classification models
- Deriving insights from visualisation

---

## 🚀 Future Work

- Implement advanced algorithms like Random Forest and SVM for better accuracy
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for model optimisation
- Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask for practice
